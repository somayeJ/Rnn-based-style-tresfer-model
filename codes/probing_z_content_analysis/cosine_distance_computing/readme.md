In file, cosine_distance_sentences.py,  in gen_score function, we insert the file names to compute the distance in between their embeddings representations as r_file and q_file (1 files that the distance between their embedding representations is to be computed)
to run the cosine_distance_sentences.py, we run the following in terminal:python cosine_distance_sentences.py  ../output_emb_files/(file directory in which r_file and q_file are stored)

This file can compute the similarity between 2 vectors representing the embedding vectors of the sequences
