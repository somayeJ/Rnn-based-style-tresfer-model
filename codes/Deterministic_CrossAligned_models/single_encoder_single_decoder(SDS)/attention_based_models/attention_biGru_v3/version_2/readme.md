**** v1.3.2.2 is the code we ran for the ICANN paper for all the datasets


I want to try to have the version v2.3.2.2 which is now the same as the v1.3.2.2,
	by modifying the attention function by multiplying the src_mask after softmax to make the pad parts equal to zero

I can check the performance by using the create z file
I have not run this yet
