data folder:
	upsampling_emb_data_balanced_emb:
 the emb representations pf yelp data set is saved here produced as the last state of encoder in different models speified by the name of folders and the test train and dev data are balanced by considering the length of bigger sized corpus and adding to the length of smaller sized corpus by replicating the data

	downsampling_data_balanced_emb:
 the emb representations pf yelp data set is saved here produced as the last state of encoder in different models speified by the name of folders and the test train and dev data are balanced by considering the length of smaller sized corpus and considering the the same length of the bigger sized corpus

	origional_synthetic: just 8 sentences that I write to test the classifiers are their embeddings are saved in ...probing classification_experiments/data/increased_data_balanced_emb/(model_name)/synthetic
